Name:Door Sensor

Principle: The Hall effect sensor works on the principle of the Hall effect, which states that 
whenever a magnetic field is applied in a direction perpendicular to the flow of electric 
current in a conductor, a potential difference is induced. This voltage can be used to detect 
whether the sensor is in the proximity of a magnet or not.

There are many types of Hall effect sensors, and certain types are better for certain applications.
For applications where the speed of detection is not crucial, ordinary Hall effect sensors like
44E can be used. However, for applications that involve high-speed detection, like in the case of
speedometers, high-frequency Hall effect sensors like US5881 or US1881 should be used. There are
two main types of Hall effect sensors: latching and non-latching.

Operation:
The US1881 is a latching Hall effect sensor. The sensor gives out an output HIGH (5V) voltage 
whenever the north pole of a magnet is brought close to it. Even when the magnet is removed,
the sensor still outputs a HIGH voltage and does not go LOW (0V) until the south pole of the magnet
is brought close to it. These sensors that latch on to a particular state are called latched 
Hall effect sensors.

The US5881 is a non-latching Hall effect sensor. The sensor gives an output HIGH voltage whenever 
the north pole of a magnet is brought close to it, and switches LOW whenever the magnet is removed. 

 PIN Connection:
 
 Vcc = 5V
 GND
 digital Connected to any PIN (interupt pin)
 Furthermore, a 10K resistor is connected between the VCC and Vout pins of the Hall effect sensor. 
 This is done to pull the output of the Hall effect sensor to 5V.

Name:led

Principle: a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it. Electrons in the semiconductor recombine with 
electron holes, releasing energy in the form of photons. The color of the light (corresponding to the energy of the photons) 
is determined by the energy required for electrons to cross the band gapof the semiconductor.

}The Grove - Light sensor integrates a photo-resistor(light dependent resistor) to detect the intensity of light. The resistance of 
photo-resistor decreases when the intensity of light increases. A dual OpAmp chip LM358 on board produces voltage corresponding to 
intensity of light(i.e. based on resistance value). The output signal is analog value, the brighter the light is, the larger the value.

This module can be used to build a light controlled switch i.e. switch off lights during day time and switch on lights during night time.

Name:IR_Sensor

Principle:
    A photo diode gives response in term of change in resistance when 
    light falls on it. That change is measured in terms of voltage.

Working:

    This is a multipurpose infrared sensor which can be used for
    color detection.The sensor provides a digital as well as 
    analog output. An on board LED is used to indicate the presence 
    of an object. This digital output can be directly connected to
    an Arduino, Raspberry Pi or any other microcontroller to 
    read the sensor output.

    IR sensors are highly susceptible to ambient light and the IR sensor
    on this sensor is suitably covered to reduce effect of ambient light 
    on the sensor. The on board potentiometer should be used to 
    calibrate the sensor.

Type of protocol:SERIAL DIGITAL & ANALOG

Applications:

    An IR LED and a Photo diode are used in a combination for proximity and 
    color detection. An IR LED (transmitter) emits IR light, that light gets 
    reflected by the object, the reflected light is received by an IR receiver 
    (Photo Diode). Amount of reflection and reception varies with the distance. 
    This difference causes to change in input voltage through IR input. 
    This variation in input voltage is used for proximity detection.

    For color detection application: The amount of reflected light depends upon 
    the color of surface from which it is reflected. The reflection is different 
    for different colored surfaces. This makes it a color detector.

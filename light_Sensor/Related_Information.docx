Name:  Light Sensor 

Principle:The Light sensor integrates a photo-resistor(light dependent resistor) to detect the intensity of light.
 The resistance of photo-resistor decreases when the intensity of light increases. A dual OpAmp chip LM358 on board 
 produces voltage corresponding to intensity of light(i.e. based on resistance value). The output signal is
 analog value, the brighter the light is, the larger the value.This module can be used to build a light controlled
  switch i.e. switch off lights during day time and switch on lights during night time.

Name: 3-Axis digital accelerometer (+-1.5 g)

Principle:
Measures the proper accelerations oaf a device.
an accelerometer behaves as a damped mass on a spring. When the accelerometer experiences an acceleration,
 the mass is displaced to the point that the spring is able to accelerate the mass at the same rate as the casing. 
 The displacement is then measured to give the acceleration.

Type of protocol:Serial

 PIN Connection: I2C Pins

Type of Sensor:Active

Codes:

#include <Wire.h> 								//for I2C pin interface
#include "MMA7660.h" 							// for accelerometer
MMA7660 acc;  									// declare a variable
void setup()
{
	acc.init();  

}
void loop()
{
	int8_t x;										//inbuilt variables  	
	int8_t y;
	int8_t z;

	float ax,ay,az;
	
acc.getXYZ(&x,&y,&z);
	
acc.getAcceleration(&ax,&ay,&az);

	delay(500);
}

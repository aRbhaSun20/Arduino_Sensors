# Arduino
>  Arduino is an **embeded microcontroller**  with a lots of pins to operate on let it be the
 -  *digital pins*, 
 - *analog pins*,
 - *I@C pins*
> formed on combinations , or be it the various Vcc or Gnd pins.
## Interaction with sensors
> In this session we are gonna have a well introduction to the basic codes we require for 
interaction of the Arduino UNO with varied number of sensors be it the
1.  Active Buzzer sensor
2.  Led
3.  Push Button
4.  Sound Sensor
5.  Capacitive Touch Sensor
6.  Light Sensor 
7.  3-Axis Digital accelerometer (+-1.5 g)
8.  Temperature sensor
9.  Rotary Sensor
10. Piezo Vibration Sensor
11. Ultra_Sonic Range Finder

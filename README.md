# Arduino

## Arduino is an **embeded microcontroller**  with a lots of pins to operate on let it be the
 
 -  *digital pins*, 
 - *analog pins*,
 - *I2C pins*
> formed on combinations , or be it the various Vcc or Gnd pins.

### Interaction with sensors

####> In this session we are gonna have a well introduction to the basic codes we require for 
interaction of the Arduino UNO with varied number of sensors be it the
1.  Accelerometer
2.  Active_Buzzer
2.  Capacitive Touch Sensor
1.  Led
6.  Light Sensor 
10. Piezo Vibration Sensor
3.  Push_Button
5.  RGB_LCD
9.  Rotary_Sensor
4.  Sound_Sensor
8.  Temperature_sensor
11. Ultra_Sonic Range Finder

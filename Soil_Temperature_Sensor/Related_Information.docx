Name:Soil_Temperature_Sensor

Principle: The soil moisture sensor consists of two probes that measure the 
volume of water in the soil. The two probes allow the electric current to 
pass through the soil and, according to its resistance, measures the 
moisture level of the soil.

Working:
When there is more water, the soil conducts more electricity, which means 
that the resistance will be less. So the moisture level will be higher. 
Dry soil reduces conductivity. So, when there is less water, the soil 
conducts less electricity, which means it has more resistance. So the 
moisture level will be lower.

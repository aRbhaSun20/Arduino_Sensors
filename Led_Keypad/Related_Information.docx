Principle:Â 
A keypad is one of the most commonly used input devices in microprocessor applications. 
In a standard keypad wired as an X-Y switch matrix, normally-open switches connect a row to a 
column when pressed. If a keypad has 12 keys, it is wired as 3 columns by 4 rows. 
A 16 key pad would have 4 columns by 4 rows.

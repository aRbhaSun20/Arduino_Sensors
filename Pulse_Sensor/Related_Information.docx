Name:Pulse Sensor

Principle:
    The sensor consists of a super bright red LED and light detector. 
    The LED needs to be super bright as the maximum light must pass spread 
    in finger and detected by detector. Now, when the heart pumps a pulse of 
    blood through the blood vessels, the finger becomes slightly more opaque and
    so less light reached the detector. With each heart pulse the detector signal
    varies. This variation is converted to electrical pulse. This signal is 
    amplified and triggered through an amplifier which outputs +5V logic level 
    signal. The output signal is also indicated by a LED which blinks 
    on each heart beat.

    RED wire = +3V to +5V
    BLACK wire = GND
    PURPLE wire = Signal

Name:Tilt_Ball_Sensor

Principle:A Tilt Sensor switch is an electronic device that detects the 
orientation of an object and gives its output High or Low accordingly.
Basically, it has a mercury ball inside it which moves and makes the 
circuit. So tilt sensor can turn on or off the circuit based on the
orientation.

Working:
    CASE 1: NOT TILTED

        Initially, when it is in NOT tilted position as shown in the
        image below, it gives LOW output because of the liquid mercury
         complete the circuit by connecting the two electrodes.
          When the output is LOW on-board LED remain ON.

    CASE 2: TILTED

        When it is inclined in a particular direction or angle, the 
        liquid mercury breaks the contact between the metal electrodes
         and the circuit gets open. Hence, we get HIGH output in this 
         condition and the onboard LED turns off.

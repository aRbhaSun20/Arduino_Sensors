Name:Square_Force_Sensor 

Principle:Â The easiest way to measure a resistive sensor is to 
connect one end to Power and the other to a pull-down resistor 
to ground. Then the point between the fixed pulldown resistor 
and the variable FSR resistor is connected to the analog input 
of a microcontroller such as an Arduino


Type of protocol:SERIAL DIGITAL & ANALOG

 PIN Connection:
 2 pins of which 
 1st = 5V
 2nd = 1st part resistor 10k to ground
        2nd part to Analog PIN

Type of Sensor:passive

    This table indicates the approximate analog voltage based on the sensor force/resistance w/a
     5V supply and 10K pulldown resistor.

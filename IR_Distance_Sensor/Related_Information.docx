Name:IR_Distance_Sensor

Principle: 
An IR distance sensor uses a beam of infrared light
to reflect off an object to measure its distance. 

The distance is calculated by using triangulation of the beam 
of light. The sensor consists of an IR LED and a light detector 
or PSD (Position Sensing Device). When the beam of light gets
reflected by an object, the reflected beam will reach 
the light detector and an ‘optical spot’ will form on the PSD.

Working:
When the position of the object changes, the angle of the 
reflected beam and the position of the spot on 
the PSD changes as well.

The sensor has a built-in signal processing circuit.
This circuit processes the position of the optical spot on 
the PSD to determine the position (distance) of the reflective object.
It outputs an analog signal which depends on the position of the 
object in front of the sensor.

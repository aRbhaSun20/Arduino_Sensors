Name: Temperature_Meter_sensor

Principle:The Grove - Temperature Sensor uses a Thermistor to detect the ambient temperature. 
The resistance of a thermistor will increase when the ambient temperature decreases. It's this characteristic
 that we use to calculate the ambient temperature. The detectable range of this sensor is -40 - 125ºC, 
 and the accuracy is ±1.5ºC.

Type of protocol:Serial

pin connection:Analog Pins

Type of sensor:Active

codes:
#include <math.h>		//for log
int a;
float temperature;
int B=3975;                  //B value of the thermistor
float resistance;
void setup()
{
}
void loop()
{
    a=analogRead(0);
    resistance=(float)(1023-a)*10000/a; //get the resistance of the sensor;
    temperature=1/(log(resistance/10000)/B+1/298.15)-273.15; // to K → C
    delay(1000);

Converting to Temperature

    Finally, of course, we want to have the temperature reading, not just a resistance! If you just need to do a 
    quick comparison circuit (if temperature is below X do this, if its above Y do that), you can simply use the
    temperature/resistance table which correlates the resistance of the thermistor to the temperature.

    However, you probably want actual temperature values. To do that we'll use the Steinhart-Hart equation , which 
    lets us do a good approximation of converting values. Its not as exact as the thermistor table 
    (it is an approximation) but its pretty good around the temperatures that this thermistor is used.

    However, this equation is fairly complex, and requires knowing a lot of variables that we don't have for this 
    thermistor. Instead we will use the simplified B parameter equation.
   
    For this one we only need to know To (which is room temperature, 25 °C = 298.15 K) B (in this case 3950, the 
    coefficient of the thermistor), and Ro (the resistance at room temp, in this case 10Kohm). We plug in R 
    (resistance measured) and get out T (temperature in Kelvin) which is easy to convert to °C

Name:FingerPrint_Sensor

Principle: The R305 is one kind of fingerprint sensor module used in biometrics for security in fingerprint detection
 as well as verification. These devices are mainly used in safes where there is a high-powered DSP chip used in the 
 rendering of image, feature-finding, searching and calculation by connecting it to any microcontroller with the help of TTL serial,
    & send data packets to get photos, notice prints, search and hash. The enrollment of new fingers can be stored directly within
 the flash memory of on board.


Type of protocol:SERIAL DIGITAL & ANALOG

 PIN Connection:
 the pins inthe fingerprint sensor:

DNC pin is connected by a white wire
VCC pin is connected by a red wire
TX pin is connected by a blue wire
RX pin is connected by a green wire
GND pin is connected by a black wire

the pins interface with arduino:

The black wire is connected to the GND pin of the Arduino
The red wire is connected to the 5V of the Arduino
Green wire is connected to the digital pin-2 of the Arduino
The white wire is connected to the digital pin-3 of the Arduino

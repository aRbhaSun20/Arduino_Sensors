Name:Thermistor_10k Sensor

Principle:Â Measure temperature using a resistor!


Type of protocol:SERIAL DIGITAL & ANALOG

 PIN Connection:ALL pins

Type of Sensor:passive

Working:
    If you are not getting correct readings, check that the
    10K resistor is placed between VCC and A0, and the thermistor 
    is between A0 and ground. Check you have a 10K Thermistor and 
    that you are using a 'standard' NTC thermistor. On a "5V" 
    microcontroller like classic Arduino or Metro 328, use 5V for 
    the VCC pin. On 3.3V microcontrollers like Feather or Arduino Zero, 
    use 3.3V for the VCC pin.

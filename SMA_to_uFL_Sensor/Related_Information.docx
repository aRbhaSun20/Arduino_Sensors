Name:SMA to uFL/u.FL/IPX/IPEX RF Adapter Cable Sensor

Principle: This RF adapter cable is super handy for anyone doing RF work.
Often times, small electronics save space by having a pick-and-placeable 
u.FL connector (also called uFL, IPEX, IPAX, IPX, MHF, and AM). But most 
antennas have SMA or RP-SMA connectors on them. This little cable will
bridge the two!

Name:PIR_Sensor

Principle:Â 
    PIR sensor detects a human being moving around within 
    approximately 10m from the sensor. This is an average value, as
    the actual detection range is between 5m and 12m.PIR are 
    fundamentally made of a pyro electric sensor, which can detect 
    levels of infrared radiation. 

Type of protocol:SERIAL DIGITAL & ANALOG

 PIN Connection:
 
 Vcc = 5V;
 GND
 OUTPUT digital pins


Type of Sensor:Active


Ratings:

Operating Voltage:	5V to 20V
Operating Current: 	65 mA max
Output Voltage:     3.3V
Delay Time:         5s to 5 minutes
Operating Temperature:  -15 to +70 degree Celsius.
Sensitivity: 110 degree cone.A knob is given to adjust the 
            sensitivity; we can vary from 3 meter to 7 meters perpendicular 
            to senor. The sensitivity reduces as we move either sides 
            of the sensor.
Quiescent current:
    The Quiescent current is the current consumed from the supply, when the 
    sensor is not detecting any motion or when it is in idle. It consumes 
    less than 50 uA, which makes the sensor battery friendly.

Specifications:
    Trigger modes:

The PIR module has two trigger modes: 
Single trigger / non-repeat mode and repeat trigger. These two modes can be 
access by changing the jumper position given in the module.

Single Trigger Mode / Non-repeat Mode:

    When the PIR sensor is set in single trigger mode (and the timer knob /
    delay time is set for 5 seconds (say)), when a human is detected the 
    output turns HIGH for 5 seconds and turns LOW.

Repeat Trigger Mode:

    When the PIR sensor is set in repeat trigger mode, when a human is 
    detected the output turns HIGH the timer counts for 5 seconds, but 
    when another human is detected with in those 5 seconds the timer 
    reset to zero and counts another 5 seconds after 2nd human is detected.

Block Time:

    The block time is the time interval where the sensor is disabled or will 
    not detect motion. The block time for HC-SR501 is 3 seconds by default.

    This occurs after the delay time (which was set by timer knob) the output goes
    LOW for 3 seconds; during this interval no motion will be detected. After the 
    3 seconds (LOW) the sensor will be ready to detect motion again.
    In other words, when the sensor detects motion the output goes HIGH, the output
    remains HIGH as per the timer knob (say 5 seconds), after 5 seconds the PIR 
    sensor goes LOW, the LOW signal will remain for 3 seconds regardless of the
    new motion if any.

Lens Size:

    The white dome structure which encloses the pyroelectric sensor is called
    Fresnel lenses, which increase the detection range and it looks opaque. 
    It measures 23 mm in diameter.

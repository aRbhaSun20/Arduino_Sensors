Name:Flex_Sensor

Principle:This flex sensor is a variable resistor like no other. The resistance of the flex sensor
 increases as the body of the component bends.

Flat (nominal resistance)
45˚ Bend (increased resistance)
90˚ Bend (resistance increased further)

Type of protocol:SERIAL DIGITAL & ANALOG

 PIN Connection:ALL pins

Type of Sensor:passive


Ratings:

Operating voltage of FLEX SENSOR: 0-5V.
Can operate on LOW voltages.
Power rating : 0.5Watt (continuous), 1 Watt (peak)
Life: 1 million.
Operating temperature: -45ºC to +80ºC.
Flat Resistance: 25K Ω
Resistance Tolerance: ±30%
Bend Resistance Range: 45K to 125K Ohms(depending on bend)
